Key Modules:

User Management: Handles registration and login for students and teachers.

Face Recognition: Uses a pre-trained model to identify students from live video or uploaded images.

Attendance Management: Automatically marks attendance based on recognized faces.

Report Generation: Generates daily, weekly, and monthly attendance reports.
